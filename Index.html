    <h1>Privacy Policy for Data Extractor for Daraz</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Data Extractor for Daraz</strong> (v1.0.2) is designed as a local-first tool for market research. We prioritize your privacy and ensure that all data processing happens entirely within your own browser.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do NOT collect, store, or ask for any personal information (names, emails, or account details).</li>
        <li><strong>No Browsing History:</strong> We do NOT track your browsing history or monitor your activities on any websites other than Daraz.pk.</li>
        <li><strong>No External Transmission:</strong> We do NOT transmit any data extracted from Daraz.pk to external servers. All data remains on your local machine.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> Since we do not collect your data, we have nothing to sell or share with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Store Locally</h2>
    <p>To provide a functional experience, the extension uses Chrome's storage API to keep track of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scraped Results:</strong> The product data you extract is stored locally so you can view, filter, and export it. This data is cleared whenever you click the "Clear Data" button or uninstall the extension.</li>
        <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> Your preferences for sorting and filtering are saved locally for your convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions Explanation</h2>
    <p>This extension requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>sidePanel:</strong> Provides a persistent interface that stays open as you browse different pages.</li>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to read the product details from the Daraz page you are currently viewing.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Necessary to run the extraction logic that identifies prices, ratings, and variants on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used to temporarily save your scraped results so you don't lose data when closing the side panel.</li>
        <li><strong>downloads:</strong> Required to allow you to save your data as Excel (.xlsx), CSV, or JSON files to your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions (daraz.pk):</strong> Restricts the extension's data access exclusively to Daraz.pk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This extension does not use any third-party services or APIs. All scraping and file generation (Excel/CSV) are performed locally using internal libraries (SheetJS).</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
